## Abstract
A system for multi-direction searching feedback, the system comprises: a signal sensing device which is worn on a user's head for detecting and receiving a signal from a signal direction; a vibration array including a first vibrating element corresponding to a first detection direction of the signal sensing device; and a processor electrically connecting the signal sensing device and the vibration array, the processor determines a first vibration strength of the first vibrating element based on the signal strength information outputted from the signal sensing device.


## What is this project about?

This project estabilished a embeded system for transferring visual information to tactile sensation. The image is modulated and transformed with FFT and neural network to identify specific objects. We used supervised learning method for detecting specific object to understand how tactile vibration can be a tool to guide users to locate the object with visual information. The purpose of this project is to be an assistive device for the visually-impaired. Thus, we called it **VisualForce**.
