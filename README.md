## Abstract
A system for multi-direction searching feedback, the system comprises: a signal sensing device which is worn on a user's head for detecting and receiving a signal from a signal direction; a vibration array including a first vibrating element corresponding to a first detection direction of the signal sensing device; and a processor electrically connecting the signal sensing device and the vibration array, the processor determines a first vibration strength of the first vibrating element based on the signal strength information outputted from the signal sensing device.
